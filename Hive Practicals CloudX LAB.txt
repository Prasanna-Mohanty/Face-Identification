Hive - MovieLens Assignment
MovieLens data sets were collected by the GroupLens Research Project at the University of Minnesota.

This data set consists of

100,000 ratings (1-5) from 943 users on 1682 movies.
Each user has rated at least 20 movies.
Simple demographic info for the users (age, gender, occupation, zip)
Movielens dataset is located at /data/ml-100k in HDFS. Read README.md file to understand the dataset.

We will load u.data file in Hive managed table. u.data contains dataset where each row represents userid, movieid, rating and timestamp fields. Fields are terminated by "\t"

Steps-

Copy the data in u_data table. Run below commands. Replace your-username with your CloudxLab username

--- Copy the data from /data directory in HDFS to your home directory in HDFS. Run below command in Linux console

hadoop fs -cp /data/ml-100k/u.data /user/your-username/

Launch hive from console or launch the Hive editor in Hue. Create a managed table u_data in your database in Hive. Run the below commands in. Replace your-username and your-database-name with your CloudxLab username

--- Create database with your CloudxLab username

CREATE DATABASE If NOT EXISTS your-username;

--- Select your database

USE your-database-name;

--- Create table

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS u_data( userid INT, movieid INT, rating INT, unixtime TIMESTAMP) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t' STORED AS TEXTFILE;

--- On hive prompt, load the data from your home directory in HDFS. Run below command in Hive query editor in Hue

LOAD DATA INPATH 'hdfs:///user/your-username/u.data' overwrite into table u_data;

Check if data is loaded. Go to warehouse directory at /apps/hive/warehouse in Hue file browser. Select your database name and go inside it. You will see u_data directory. Go inside it and see if data exists.

select * from u_data order by movieid desc limit 10;
